Hybrid Exchange Powershell Scripts

Just a bunch of scripts to help with common tasks in hybrid exchange such as mailbox creation, license application, and conversion to and from shared mailboxes.

All script usage, requirements, and what variables need to be set by the user are listed in the comments at the beginning of each script.
